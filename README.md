# Otto's Final Systems Project

### Group Buff

### Project Description:

This project will allow clients to access files from a server – a collaborative text editor. The clients will be able to read and modify the files in the server, and the files will be stored in a linked list. Files will be stored in a linked list, and the client will be able to select a file to create, open, close, modify, read, or clear. The contents of the file will be printed to the client, who will be able to modify it by adding a line or clearing the file. The client sends back the modified file to the server.
  
### Instructions:

The user will be prompted to enter a file number. Once this is entered, the user will be prompted to enter a line number within that file. That line will be printed to the user, who will have the option of modifying the line or leaving it as it is. The user sends the line back to the server.
